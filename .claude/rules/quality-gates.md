# Quality Gates & Scoring Rubrics

## Thresholds

- **80/100 = Commit** -- good enough to save
- **90/100 = PR** -- ready for deployment
- **95/100 = Excellence** -- aspirational

| Major | Text overflow | -5 |
| Major | TikZ label overlap | -5 |
| Major | Notation inconsistency | -3 |
| Minor | Font size reduction | -1 per slide |
| Minor | Long lines (>100 chars) | -1 (EXCEPT documented math formulas) |

## R Scripts (.R)

| Severity | Issue | Deduction |
|----------|-------|-----------|

| Critical | XeLaTeX compilation failure | -100 |
| Critical | Undefined citation | -15 |
| Critical | Overfull hbox > 10pt | -10 |

## STATA Do-files (.do)

| Severity | Issue | Deduction |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Critical | Do-file fails to run end-to-end | -100 |
| Critical | Hardcoded absolute paths | -20 |
| Critical | Code implements different estimator than slides describe | -15 |
| Major | Missing `set seed` before bootstrap/simulation | -10 |
| Major | No `log using` for reproducibility | -10 |
| Major | Figures or tables not saved (screen-only output) | -5 |
| Major | Figures not using Okabe-Ito colorblind-safe palette | -5 |
| Minor | Missing section-divider comments | -3 |

## Enforcement

- **Score < 80:** Block commit. List blocking issues.
- **Score < 90:** Allow commit, warn. List recommendations.
- User can override with justification.

## Quality Reports

Generated **only at merge time**. Use `templates/quality-report.md` for format.
Save to `quality_reports/merges/YYYY-MM-DD_[branch-name].md`.

## Tolerance Thresholds (Research)

<!-- Customize for your domain -->

| Quantity | Tolerance | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Point estimates | ±1e-4 | Numerical precision in STATA replication |
| Standard errors | ±1e-3 | Bootstrap/MC variability |
| Coverage rates | ±0.01 | MC with finite simulation draws |
